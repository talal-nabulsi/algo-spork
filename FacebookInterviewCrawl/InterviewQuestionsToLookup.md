>Phone Screen Find the number of subsequences such that min(subseq) + max(subseq) == k. I was able to finish it quickly but missed one edge case. The second question was min(subSeq) + max(subSeq) <= k. This was an interesting problem and I missed one edge case again. I was able to solve it with a hint but found the problem challenging because of the edge cases. Damn the edge cases :)



>IsSplitPossible => Given an array of positive integers, is it possible to split the array in two parts such that the sum of parts is equal. This is a very easy problem using prefix Sum

>Implement readline method using Read4k() => Not too challenging. I thought I solved it well but interviewer thought I missed a case.

# Trees

* A **full binary tree** is a binary tree where every node has exactly 0 or 2 children.
* A **complete binary tree** is a tree where all levels except for possibly last are filled and nodes are far left as possible.
* A **perfect binary** tree is a tree where all levels completely filled

* Max nodes at each level i = 2^i. (staring at level 0)

* Max nodes in total 2^h−1

* Height of perfect binary tree : log2​(n+1)=h

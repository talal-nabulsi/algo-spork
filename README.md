Complete Binary Tree - All levels except for possibly last are filled and nodes are far left as possible.

Perfect Binary Tree = All levels completely filled

Max nodes at each level i = 2^i. (staring at level 0)

Max nodes in total 2^nâˆ’1


# In perfect binary trees there's a cool mathematical relationship between the number of nodes and the height of the tree.

First, there's a pattern to how many nodes are on each level:

Level 0: 2^0=12 
0
 =1 nodes,
Level 1: 2^1=22 
1
 =2 nodes,
Level 22: 2^2=42 
2
 =4 nodes,
Level 33: 2^3=82 
3
 =8 nodes,
etc
